# Anas — Local Desktop AI Agent

[简体中文](README.md) · [English](README.en.md)

Anas is a local desktop AI agent built with Electron, React, and TypeScript, powered by LangGraph and Deep Agents. Each project can choose its context, tools, skills, and subagents. Configuration and conversations stay locally; requests send the required task content to the selected model provider.

The application's Help menu opens bundled guides in the right workspace pane, with a contents list and saved reading positions.

## Features

- OpenAI-compatible and Anthropic-compatible providers, streamed replies, context compression, and resumable approvals.
- Default capabilities in Settings, optional project customization, and independently configured subagents.
- Built-in file, image, network, memory, and command tools; bundled ripgrep; MCP integration and custom tool packages.
- User and project Skills, prompt shortcuts, input history, and speech input/output.
- Text, image, PDF, and DOCX attachments. Images use native multimodal content blocks; documents are extracted locally.
- A resizable right workspace for subagents, help, and read-only Git or recorded file differences. Monaco supports inline and side-by-side comparison; settings retain a two-column layout.
- Local data backup, restore, logs, and startup recovery.

Capability selection and execution approval are separate. See the user guide for each capability's tools and dependencies, and the security model for the three conversation access modes.

## Runtime architecture

LangChain, LangGraph, and Deep Agents own the model/tool loop, messages, checkpoints, interrupts, retries, and subagent orchestration. LangGraph's current checkpoint state is the conversation source of truth. Anas owns Electron lifecycle, configuration, projects, presentation, backups, and other product services.

Each main conversation and its subagents share a SQLite database; the catalog stores conversation locations and shared memory. Completed messages are stored individually, without a second application-owned model history. The current implementation rejects unsupported storage formats and has no legacy-format migration path. The first public `3.0.0` release will establish the compatibility baseline; subsequent format changes must provide upgrade paths for supported releases under the [compatibility policy](AGENTS.md#发布兼容性). Pre-release development formats and reading newer data with an older app are outside that guarantee. See [Current state storage](docs/CURRENT_STATE_STORAGE.md).

Ordinary tools share a managed executor with **8 execution slots** and a **64-call active/queued limit**. Busy slots and conflicting mutations queue automatically. With Background tools enabled, a call waiting or running for over 10 seconds returns a handle for supervision. Cancellation retains execution ownership until the real executor settles; uncertain external outcomes are explicit. Planning, subagent orchestration, user questions, and supervision remain outside this execution pool.

Custom tools run in their package directory. User packages live in `tools/` under the data directory; project packages live in `.agents/tools/` under each source folder. They require explicit capability selection. See [Custom tool packages](docs/CUSTOM_TOOLS.md) for execution and import rules.

Shell commands preserve the model's command text, arguments, and search behavior. Supported read-only commands may be approved automatically after target and environment checks; analysis does not rewrite commands to obtain approval. Other commands follow the selected access mode. The security model defines platform support and recovery rules.

## Development

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), check the working tree and recent Git history, then install dependencies for the host platform. Optional npm dependencies are required for bundled ripgrep and native modules.

Use Node.js 24 with npm and Git. Install on the target operating system; do not copy `node_modules` between platforms. Native modules may require platform build tools if a matching prebuilt binary is unavailable. Python is needed only for Python-based tools, Skills, or their tests. On Windows PowerShell, use `npm.cmd` if the execution policy blocks `npm.ps1`.

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm test -- <test-file>
npm run build
```

After startup, add your model provider in **Settings > Model**, then select a model in the message toolbar. No model service credentials are bundled. `data/config/` and `data/.env` are distribution defaults; store personal settings and keys in the application's data directory.

`build` checks types, builds main/preload/renderer resources, and verifies main-process dependency boundaries. Run relevant tests for changed behavior. Electron checks use isolated data directories:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --help-only
npm run test:e2e -- --startup-only
npm run test:e2e -- --storage-only
```

Run builds and packaging serially with backend tests because they share generated output and native dependencies.

| Directory | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main/agent/` | Agent construction, persistence, lifecycle, and IPC |
| `src/main/` | Electron and product services |
| `src/preload/` | Typed `window.gale` bridge |
| `src/renderer/` | React workspace, settings, and shared controls |
| `src/shared/` | Shared types and helpers |
| `data/` | Bundled configuration, help, languages, skills, examples, and assets |
| `patches/` | Required dependency patches applied by `postinstall` |

## Data directory

The default is `~/.gale<program-name>/`, normally `~/.galeAnas/`. The physical executable or application bundle name determines the packaged program name. A renamed copy can use a separate data directory.

Override it with the first application argument, `--data-dir <path>`, or `--data-dir=<path>`. Relative paths resolve from the launch directory; filesystem roots are rejected.

```bash
Anas.exe --data-dir "D:\Anas Data\Research"
./Anas.AppImage --data-dir "$HOME/Anas Data/Research"
npm run dev -- -- --data-dir "./runtime-data/research"
```

| Path under the data directory | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `config/` | Settings, default capabilities, providers/models, subagents, MCP, Skill sources/availability, and custom-tool ordering |
| `sqlite/catalog.sqlite` | Main conversation directory and shared memory |
| `sqlite/conversations/<threadId>.sqlite` | One main conversation and its subagents |
| `projects.json` | Project definitions and source folders |
| `.env` | Application environment variables |
| `attachments/`, `file_edits/` | Saved attachments and file-edit recovery material |
| `skills/`, `tools/` | User-managed packages |
| `skills_system/`, `skills_examples/`, `tools_examples/` | Bundled packages refreshed at startup; examples must be imported before use |
| `help/`, `lang/` | Help and language packs |
| `assets/`, `log/`, `cache/`, `tmp/`, `electron/` | Assets, logs, cache, temporary files, and Electron profile |

Project source folders are separate from application data. Backups include user tool/Skill packages and use SQLite snapshots, but do not back up project source folders or external Skill roots. They exclude `dev/`, `electron/`, `log/`, and `tmp/`. Restore validates and stages the archive, creates a pre-restore backup, replaces application data, and reloads the app.

Bundled help, system Skills, examples, and built-in language packs are refreshed by the app; edit user packages or add a separate language file instead. See [Language packs](data/lang/README.md).

## Packaging

```bash
npm run pack       # local unpacked application
npm run dist       # alias for pack
npm run portable   # Windows x64 portable package
npm run pack:win:release  # Windows x64 application folder in a ZIP
npm run pack:mac:release  # ad-hoc signed DMG for the current Mac architecture
```

On macOS, `pack` creates an ad-hoc signed app in `release-build/`, without certificate signing, timestamps, or notarization. It does not require `sudo`. Packaging verifies bundled dependencies, including native ripgrep; cross-platform builds require the target platform's packages.

`pack:mac:release` runs on a Mac and produces an ARM64 DMG on Apple Silicon or an x64 DMG on Intel, under `release-macos/`. It uses ad-hoc signing without an Apple developer account, signing certificate, timestamp, or notarization. The build checks the signature and runs the packaged smoke checks. A downloaded app may require **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway** after the first launch attempt.

`pack:win:release` runs on Windows x64, verifies the application, then writes `release-build/Anas-<version>-windows-x64.zip`. Extract it and run `Anas/Anas.exe`; keep the entire folder. User data still uses the normal application data directory. Release commands use the standard Electron download endpoints unless mirror environment variables are explicitly set, and never upload packages themselves.

The [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) builds all three packages on native hosts when a `v<version>` tag is pushed. It publishes a GitHub Release with the three downloads and SHA-256 checksums only after all builds pass. **Run workflow** builds downloadable artifacts without publishing a Release. See [source snapshot publishing](docs/SOURCE_PUBLISHING.md) for repository setup and release steps.

### Opening the macOS download

Download the DMG matching your Mac from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/higale/anas-agent/releases), open it, and drag Anas into Applications. Launch the installed copy. If macOS blocks it because the developer cannot be verified, use **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Open Anyway**, then confirm **Open**, as described by [Apple](https://support.apple.com/102445).

If that route does not resolve a download-quarantine block, and you trust this release, compare the DMG's `shasum -a 256` output with its entry in the release's `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Then remove only the installed Anas app's quarantine attribute:

```bash
xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Anas.app"
```

Adjust the path if installed elsewhere. Use `sudo` before this command only if it fails with a permissions error and the path is correct. This removes download quarantine; it does not repair a damaged app or provide Apple notarization. For a signature verification failure, download a fresh copy; do not bypass a malware warning.

The release build already applies and verifies an ad-hoc signature. Users should not normally run `codesign --force --deep --sign -`: it replaces nested signatures, and [Apple reserves deep signing for emergency repairs](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2206/). Developers can rebuild with `npm run pack:mac:release` instead. A future release using [Developer ID signing and Apple notarization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution) would avoid the unidentified-developer/notarization block; current releases use ad-hoc signing.
